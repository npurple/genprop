Older changelogs
================
v1.52 - Fixed the field chooser dialog assertion failure. -- VinceMallet - 24 Oct 2003
v1.51 - Migrated to Aurora build 957. Known problem: field chooser dialog fails assertion. -- VinceMallet - 24 Oct 2003
v1.50 - Aurora build 833 version. I only did simple tests for this version, so some problems could exist if you use a template thats different than the default. But I wanted to release a version that works in Aurora.
v1.21 - Implemented bugfix in UI settigs submitted by Igor Levit - thanks Igor.
v1.2 - Removed default keyboard shortcut, since it can be invoked from the generate menu alt + ins. Added method matchName(regExp) on FieldElement to be able to perform regular expression matching on fieldname in the velocity template. Scrollbar added to velocity template text area if needed. Added filtering of unwanted fields in settings (constant, transient and by fieldname). An error dialog is presented if an exception is thrown while performing the action. Added icon for configuration.
v1.1 - Renamed field $field.transient to $field.modifierTransiet. Added many new varaibles to velocity context. Integrated code contributions from Igor Levit - Refactored code to use ConflictResultionPolicy pattern insteed of enumeration for options, A better UI for the settings, and the "Always overwrite" option is now a more generic "Always apply default resolution policy" and finally the action is disabled in menu's for non javafiles... All this thanks to Igor Levit.
v1.0 - Added action to generate... menu (alt + insert). Thanks to Glen Schrader for the info.
v0.9 - Added new varaibles to velocity context ($field.string, $field.objectArray, $field.primitiveArray). Fixed bug in generated code for primitive array types. Single quotes around dumped values for String fields. Automatic import of java.util.Arrays if Arrays is used in the javacode.
v0.8 - Reusing IDEA's dialog for choosing fields. Added new variables to velocity context ($field.primitive, $field.constant, $field.transient, $FQClassname). Changed "method exists dialog", and added a new default settings for it. Action added to Code menu, and removed from the Other mainmenu.
v0.7 - Using Roman Porotnikov's velocity variation as default. Added field option map. Now handles evaluation of types for Collection and Map using isAssignableFrom method calls so all kind of objects are regonized as a Collection/Map properly. New dialog to select fields, enable/disable it in the settings. Thanks to Martin Schmid (author of the greate SimpleUML plugin) for the dialog code.
v0.6 - All code is now generated using a velocity template. See the template in Options -> IDE Settings. Now handles arrays and collections to dump their contents.
v0.5 - Fixed problem using same Velocity engine as IDEA. Cosmetic fix for body code when no fields and for first field. Updated javadoc.
v0.4 - Added Velocity template for method body code generation. Added build.xml in source distribution.
v0.3 - Can generate methods for inner classes. Added UML diagram to javadoc. Doesn't generate field dump for constant fields.
v0.2 - Removed super call option.
v0.1 - Initial version.
