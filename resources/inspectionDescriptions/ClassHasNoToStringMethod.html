            This inspection reports any classes with no toString() method.
            <p>
            This inspection will use the exclude settings from the plugin configuration to ignore classes having fields
            not supposed to be dumped. An additional settings is to exclude certain classes by using a regular expression
            matching the classname. As default this is used to exclude any <font color="#000080">Exception</font> classes.
